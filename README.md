T6 â€“ the Tails.com infrasTrucTure Tech TesT
=======================================

You are the newest member of the Tails.com infrastructure team. Welcome!

Your first assignment is to help Fido, a junior developer at Tails.com. Fido picked up a story in the backlog of building and deploying an API to determine if a dog's tail is going to wag when given a command. Fido needs your help to bring this service to production.

Included in this folder is:
- Fido's first attempt at a Dockerfile
- Fido's code for the microservice, `app.py`
- The command database at `wag_or_not.sqlite`

Fido added:

> It works on my machine, I don't understand why it doesn't work in Docker!

Your task
---------

Turn this first attempt into a service you'd consider ready to be deployed into production by a CI/CD pipeline.

Keep in mind Fido is pretty junior, so you should expect plenty of teaching moments in what he's presented.

This includes:
- The Dockerfile must work
- Fido must have instructions on how to run it on their machine
- The project must be in a state you deem good enough to deploy into a production environment

Anything you wish to do in addition to this will be taken into account but is not essential. If you'd like to mention any other aspects of what you've done, or potential future improvements, feel free to add them in a `README.md` file.

We expect this task to take ~ 1 hour of your time, but feel free to spend more time if you wish.
